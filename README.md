## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior in online retail using transactional data and the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework to segment customers based on purchase recency, transaction frequency, and total spending value.

## Objective 
- Identify high-value customers by analyzing purchase patterns to determine which customers contribute the most to revenue.
- Segment customers based on behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics to tailor marketing strategies effectively.
- Enhance customer retention and engagement by understanding transactional habits and targeting interventions to improve loyalty and repeat purchases.

## Dataset

## Conclusions
- Majority of Customers Are Inactive
- Nearly Half of Customers Need Urgent Intervention
- High-Value Segments Are Relatively Balanced
- Growth Opportunities Exist in Mid-Tier Segments

## Suggestions
